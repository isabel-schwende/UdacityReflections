Udacity lesson 3 reflections for git and github class

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
There are several reasons why I would want to work on a remote.
a) it's safer as the content is stored in the cloud - so even when the local copy is lost, the content is safe
b) other people can contribute 
c) I can work on the same code from different devices

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can work on it when I don't have internet access.
