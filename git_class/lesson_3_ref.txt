Udacity lesson 3 reflections for git and github class

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
There are several reasons why I would want to work on a remote.
a) it's safer as the content is stored in the cloud - so even when the local copy is lost, the content is safe
b) other people can contribute 
c) I can work on the same code from different devices

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can work on it when I don't have internet access. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using something like dropbox to host files online and share with collaborators. 
Pro: works for people who don't know how to use Git or are not programmers 
Contra: many useful functions of Git are missing, it's by far not as convenient and powerful
It makes sense for certain types of code -> I use some other system for shared Latex projects
