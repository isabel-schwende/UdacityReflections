What happens when you initialize a repo?
It creates a .git file that contains all settings for this repository in default settings.
Why do you need to do it?
We need the .git file to proceed further - it becomes our starting point.

Staging area difference to working dir and repo?
Temporary area where we can arrange files for commits regardless of their location in the file system before adding them to the repository. 
What is the value?
Arrange first before committing - ensure logical coherence of files.
